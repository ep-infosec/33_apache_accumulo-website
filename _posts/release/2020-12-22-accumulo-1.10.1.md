Users of 1.10.0 or earlier are urged to upgrade to 1.10.1 as soon as possible,

## Note About JDK 15

Accumulo 1.x assumes the use of the CMS garbage collector in its build tests
and in the minicluster code. That garbage collector was removed in newer
versions of Java, and the build flags for Java that supported configuring the
CMS garbage collector now cause errors if attempted to be used with Java 15 or
later.

Therefore, a change was made in 1.10.1's build to fail fast if attempting to
build with JDK 15 or later (using JDK 11 or later was already a build
requirement).

If you need to build on JDK 15 or later, and intend to skip tests and don't
intend to use minicluster, you can bypass this build constraint by building
with `-Denforcer.skip`, as a workaround.
