Apache Accumulo 1.6.3 is a maintenance release on the 1.6 version branch.
This release contains changes from over 63 issues, comprised of bug-fixes,
performance improvements and better test cases. See [JIRA][JIRA_163] for a
complete list.

Below are resources for this release:

* [User Manual](/1.6/accumulo_user_manual.html)
* [Javadocs](/1.6/apidocs)
* [Examples](/1.6/examples)

Users of 1.6.0, 1.6.1, and 1.6.2 are strongly encouraged to update as soon as
possible to benefit from the improvements with very little concern in change
of underlying functionality. Users of 1.4 or 1.5 that are seeking to upgrade
to 1.6 should consider 1.6.3 as a starting point.

## Fixed BatchWriter hold time error

In previous releases, a `BatchWriter` could fail with a
`MutationsRejectedException` with server errors. If inspection of the tserver
logs showed `HoldTimeoutException` was the cause, the workaround was to
increase the value of `general.rpc.timeout`. Changing this setting is no
longer necessary as this bug was fixed by [ACCUMULO-2388][ACCUMULO-2388].

## Severe bug fixes

 * [ACCUMULO-3597][ACCUMULO-3597] Fixed a deadlock where a table flush and
   metadata tablet load were waiting on each other.  This was a rare bug. If it
   occurred it could impact the availability of Accumulo as most Accumulo
   operations depend on metadata tablets.
 * [ACCUMULO-3709][ACCUMULO-3709] Fixed a potential data loss bug where
   AccumuloOutputFormat close did not rethrow exception.
 * [ACCUMULO-3745][ACCUMULO-3745] Fixed a deadlock in SourceSwitchingIterator
   that occurred when using custom iterators that called `deepCopy`.  This bug
   would cause scans to hang indefinitely until the offending tserver was killed.
 * [ACCUMULO-3859][ACCUMULO-3859] Fixed a race condition that could prevent table
   constraints from ever loading for a Tablet. It is likely to only affect users
   when the constraint is first added to a table.

## Notable bug fixes

 * [ACCUMULO-3589][ACCUMULO-3589] `du` in Shell does not check table existence.
 * [ACCUMULO-3692][ACCUMULO-3692] Offline'ing a table disabled subsequent balancing.
 * [ACCUMULO-3696][ACCUMULO-3696] Tracing could queue too many traces
 * [ACCUMULO-3718][ACCUMULO-3718] Fixed a bug that prevented a Mutation from
   being created in Scala.
 * [ACCUMULO-3747][ACCUMULO-3747] Thrashing tablet servers would be removed from the Monitor's Dead Server list.
 * [ACCUMULO-3750][ACCUMULO-3750] Fixed an issue where the Master would perpetually
   fail when there was a bad `instance.secret` setting.
 * [ACCUMULO-3784][ACCUMULO-3784] Fixed a bug in `getauths` Shell command where it
   treated visibilities that differed only in case as the same.
 * [ACCUMULO-3796][ACCUMULO-3796] Added documentation about turning off zone
   reclaim.
 * [ACCUMULO-3880][ACCUMULO-3880] Fixed an issue where malformed configuration caused
   TabletServers to shutdown.
 * [ACCUMULO-3890][ACCUMULO-3890] Fixed a performance issue with CredentialProvider. Information
   stored in the CredentialProvider was not cached which resulted in repeatedly reading the
   file from HDFS which can degrade HDFS performance.

## Known Issues

During testing [HDFS-8406][1] was encountered which is summarized by write-ahead log recovery
that was never completed due to an inability to recover the HDFS lease on the WAL. To work around
this issue, the following steps can be done:

 1. Locate block for walog whose lease can not be recovered.
 2. Copy block into HDFS as temp file TMP_WALOG
 3. Delete the walog whose lease can not be recovered.
 4. Move TMP_WALOG to the filename of the walog deleted in the previous step.

Using the `fetchColumns()` method on a scanner in conjunction with custom iterators that
add column families in their `seek()` method can lead to unexpected behavior.  See
[ACCUMULO-3905][ACCUMULO-3905] for more details.  In that issue javadoc updates were made,
but the updates did not make it into 1.6.3.

## Testing

Each unit and functional test only runs on a single node, while the RandomWalk
and Continuous Ingest tests run on any number of nodes. *Agitation* refers to
randomly restarting Accumulo processes and Hadoop Datanode processes, and, in
HDFS High-Availability instances, forcing NameNode failover.
