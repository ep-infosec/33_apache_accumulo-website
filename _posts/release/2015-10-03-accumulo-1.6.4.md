Apache Accumulo 1.6.4 is a maintenance release on the 1.6 version branch.
This release contains changes from 21 issues, comprised of bug-fixes,
performance improvements and better test cases. See [JIRA][JIRA_164] for a
complete list.

Below are resources for this release:

* [User Manual](/1.6/accumulo_user_manual.html)
* [Javadocs](/1.6/apidocs)
* [Examples](/1.6/examples)

Users of any previous 1.6.x release are strongly encouraged to update as soon as
possible to benefit from the improvements with very little concern in change
of underlying functionality. Users of 1.4 or 1.5 that are seeking to upgrade
to 1.6 should consider 1.6.4 as a starting point.

## Silent data-loss via bulk imported files

A user recently reported that a simple bulk-import application would occasionally
lose some records. Through investigation, it was found that when bulk imports into
a table failed the initial assignment, the logic that automatically retries the
imports was incorrectly choosing the tablets to import the files into. [ACCUMULO-3967][ACCUMULO-3967]
contains more information on the cause and identification of the bug. The data-loss
condition would only affect entire files. If records from a file exist in Accumulo,
it is still guaranteed that all records within that imported file were successful.

As such, users who have bulk import applications using previous versions of Accumulo
should verify that all of their data was correctly ingested into Accumulo and
immediately update to Accumulo 1.6.4.

## Other bug fixes

 * [ACCUMULO-3979][ACCUMULO-3979] Fixed an issue where the BulkImporter failed
   with an error message "QUERY_METADATA already started".
 * [ACCUMULO-3965][ACCUMULO-3965] The `listscans` shell command did not contain
   the `scanId` attribute for currently running scans.
 * [ACCUMULO-3946][ACCUMULO-3946] Verified that all user-facing operations contained
   appropriate audit messages.
 * [ACCUMULO-3977][ACCUMULO-3977] Isolated scans with Iterators in use incorrectly
   fail around invocation of `deepCopy`.
 * [ACCUMULO-3905][ACCUMULO-3905] RowDeletingIterator functions incorrectly when
   columns are provided by the client. This restores intended functionality without
   the need for a [workaround][3905-workaround].
 * [ACCUMULO-3959][ACCUMULO-3959] [ACCUMULO-3934][ACCUMULO-3934] Multiple documentation
   improvements to `BatchScanner`.

## Testing

Each unit and functional test only runs on a single node, while the RandomWalk
and Continuous Ingest tests run on any number of nodes. *Agitation* refers to
randomly restarting Accumulo processes and Hadoop Datanode processes, and, in
HDFS High-Availability instances, forcing NameNode failover.
