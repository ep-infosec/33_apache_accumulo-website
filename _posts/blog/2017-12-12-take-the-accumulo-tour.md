title: "Take the Accumulo Tour!"
---

Apache Accumulo now has a [hands-on tour][tour] that introduces users to key Accumulo concepts
by completing a series of programming exercises. Don't worry! Solutions are provided if
you get stuck.

The [tour] has a 'Getting Started' page that helps you set up your development environment and
clone a repository with template code. After you are set up, the tour has exercises that cover the
following Accumulo concepts:

 * Writing and Reading from Accumulo
 * Data Model
 * Authorizations
 * Ranges & Splits
 * Batch Scanner
 * Conditional Writer

More exercises (such as one on Accumulo Iterators) will be added in the future so check for updates.
