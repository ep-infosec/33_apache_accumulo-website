This month, Apache Accumulo is celebrating five years as a top-level project
at the Apache Software Foundation.

To celebrate, we got a cake!

The community would like to thank everyone that has been a part of Accumulo
over the past years and to those involved before that during its time in the ASF Incubator.

As always, we look forward to continued activity from everyone. Happy Accumul-ating!
